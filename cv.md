Since April 5, I have been studying Front-End Development at IT-school “TeachMeSkills”. At this stage, I am familiar with working in HTML5, CSS3 (SASS, LESS), JavaScript, React. I am looking for an opportunity to have a trainee of a Front-End Developer with subsequent employment.

I have developed my soft skills that would be suitable for a Front-End Developer position. I have an analytical mindset. I am enthusiastic about learning new things in my profession and interrelated spheres. I’m easily trained. I’m good at human communication, have empathy and I identify problems easily . I'm creative and I can suggest various solutions. I have experience in public speaking (but not in English) and I can explain complicated notions in simple terms.
